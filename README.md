- What is a recommender system?
  
  A recommender system uses machine learning algorithm to suggest items based on the user preference and behavioral pattern.
- Types of recommender system
  
  1.Content based recommendation system : it recommends based on the similarity of the content
  
  2.Collaborative filtering based recommendation system : it recommends content based on the similarity of the user
  
  3.Hybrid recommendation system : It is the combination of the above two.


In this project I have used CONTENT BASED RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM.
